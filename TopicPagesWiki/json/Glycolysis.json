    "summary": "Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose (C6H12O6) into pyruvate and, in most organisms, occurs in the liquid part of cells (the cytosol). The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy molecules adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Glycolysis is a sequence of ten reactions catalyzed by enzymes.\n\nThe wide occurrence of glycolysis in other species indicates that it is an ancient metabolic pathway. Indeed, the reactions that make up glycolysis and its parallel pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, can occur in the oxygen-free conditions of the Archean oceans, also in the absence of enzymes, catalyzed by metal ions, meaning this is a plausible prebiotic pathway for abiogenesis.\nThe most common type of glycolysis is the Embden\u2013Meyerhof\u2013Parnas (EMP) pathway, which was discovered by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and Jakub Karol Parnas. Glycolysis also refers to other pathways, such as the Entner\u2013Doudoroff pathway and various heterofermentative and homofermentative pathways. However, the discussion here will be limited to the Embden\u2013Meyerhof\u2013Parnas pathway.\nThe glycolysis pathway can be separated into two phases:\n\nInvestment phase \u2013 wherein ATP is consumed\nYield phase \u2013 wherein more ATP is produced than originally consumed",
