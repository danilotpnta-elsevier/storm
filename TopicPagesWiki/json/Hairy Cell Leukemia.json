    "summary": "Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon hematological malignancy characterized by an accumulation of abnormal B lymphocytes. The incidence of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is 0.28-0.30 cases per 100,000 people in Europe and the United States and the prevalence is 3 cases per 100,000 in Europe with a lower prevalence in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\nHCL has an indolent course but with frequent relapses, but with treatment life expectancy is usually the same as that for the general population.\nHCL was originally described as histiocytic leukemia, malignant reticulosis, or lymphoid myelofibrosis in publications dating back to the 1920s. The disease was formally named leukemic reticuloendotheliosis, and its characterization was significantly advanced by Bertha Bouroncle and colleagues at the Ohio State University College of Medicine in 1958.  Its common name, which was coined in 1966, is derived from the \"hairy\" appearance of the cytoplasmic projections from malignant B cells under a microscope.",
