  "summary": "Zillennials, or Zennials, is a social cohort encompassing people born on the cusp of, or during the latter years of the Millennial generation and the early years of Generation Z. Their adjacency between the two generations and limited age set has led to their characterization as a \"micro-generation\". They are generally the children of younger Baby Boomers and Generation X. Estimates of the U.S. population in this cohort range from 30 million to 48 million. \nIn early childhood during the September 11 terrorist attacks, they were the first cohort to experience adolescence in a post-9/11 world. The majority of this cohort came of age during the 2010s, with the U.K. Brexit referendum and U.S. presidential election of 2016, COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020\u20132021 George Floyd protests being key formative events. Zillennials experienced the sudden global Digital Revolution of the late 2000s and 2010s, navigating mobile LTE internet, cell phones, mobile devices and smartphones.\nZillennials code-switch between generations, have high levels of digital literacy, and are more likely to self-identify into a minority group. Zillennials are less wealthy but more economically secure than Generation Z, commanding relatively high spending power in the U.S. economy, especially when compared to millennials. They have high brand loyalty, low price sensitivity, and stable purchasing patterns.",
