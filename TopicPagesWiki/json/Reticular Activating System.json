    "summary": "The reticular formation is a set of interconnected nuclei in the brainstem that spans from the lower end of the medulla oblongata to the upper end of the midbrain. The neurons of the reticular formation make up a complex set of neural networks in the core of the brainstem. The reticular formation is made up of a diffuse net-like formation of reticular nuclei which is not well-defined. It may be seen as being made up of all the interspersed cells in the brainstem between the more compact and named structures.\nThe reticular formation is functionally divided into the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), ascending pathways to the cerebral cortex, and the descending reticular system, descending pathways (reticulospinal tracts) to the spinal cord. Due to its extent along the brainstem it may be divided into different areas such as the midbrain reticular formation, the central mesencephalic reticular formation, the pontine reticular formation, the paramedian pontine reticular formation, the dorsolateral pontine reticular formation, and the medullary reticular formation.\nNeurons of the ARAS basically act as an on/off switch to the cerebral cortex and hence play a crucial role in regulating wakefulness; behavioral arousal and consciousness are functionally related in the reticular formation using a number of neurotransmitter arousal systems. The overall functions of the reticular formation are modulatory and premotor,\ninvolving somatic motor control, cardiovascular control, pain modulation, sleep and consciousness, and habituation. The modulatory functions are primarily found in the rostral sector of the reticular formation and the premotor functions are localized in the neurons in more caudal regions.\nThe reticular formation is divided into three columns: raphe nuclei (median), gigantocellular reticular nuclei (medial zone), and parvocellular reticular nuclei (lateral zone). The raphe nuclei are the place of synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which plays an important role in mood regulation. The gigantocellular nuclei are involved in motor coordination. The parvocellular nuclei regulate exhalation.\nThe reticular formation is essential for governing some of the basic functions of higher organisms. It is phylogenetically old and found in lower vertebrates.",
